<h4>Basic information</h4>
<p>The Pokémon franchise revolves around 802 eponymous fictional species of characters, each having unique designs and skills. The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into "Generations", with each division encompassing new main series titles and a change of handheld platform. Generation I refers to Red, Green, Blue and Yellow; Generation II refers to Gold, Silver, and Crystal; Generation III refers to Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald; Generation IV refers to Diamond, Pearl , and Platinum; Generation V refers to Black, White, Black 2, and White 2, Generation VI refers to X and Y; and Generation VII refers to Sun, Moon. Each Generation is also marked by the addition of new Pokémon: 151 in Generation I, 100 in Generation II, 135 in Generation III, 107 in Generation IV, 156 in Generation V, 72 in Generation VI, and 81 in Generation VII.</p>

<p>Originally, all Pokémon were designed by Ken Sugimori, however, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs. Designs, in general, have become increasingly complex and thematic in newer games. The new Pokémon of Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). Each iteration of the series has brought about praise and criticism over the numerous creatures. Multiple Pokémon feature alternate forms that change their appearance, stats, and viable attacks; however, these do not count as separate species. Furthermore, 48 creatures are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion, a variant of normal evolution that is akin to a form change (including a modest change in appearance alongside stat buffs).</p>

<p>Due to the large number of Pokémon, listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. All 802 Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an in-game electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, Generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in Gold and Silver in addition to the original 151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon.</p>
